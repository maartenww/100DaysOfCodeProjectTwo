CURRICULUM Project two
What have I learned from this project?

- I learned about the structure of a game loop and how to optimize it to not only design but create a smoothly working game
- More documentation from the Pygame Library
- More about python classes and inheritance
- More about the 'self' thing in python

What can i keep in mind for next time?

- It's ok to spend long on designing for it will help you alot when you are actually creating something
- Spend time on thinking on what your next project will be so that when you think of your goal you stay motivated and inpsired to keep on working on it. Also more progress will be made on the project.
